## Core Domain Concepts

### The Lending Lifecycle

```
Customer → Application → [Approved?] → Loan → Payments → [Paid Off / Defaulted]
```

- A **customer** (business borrower) submits an **application**
- Applications are either **approved** (becomes a **loan**) or **rejected**
- Loans receive **payments** over time according to a **repayment_schedule**
- Loans end as either **paid_off** or **defaulted** (recorded in **default_event**)

### Risk Grading System

Loans are assigned a **risk_grade** (A through E) based on credit score ranges:

| Grade | Credit Score Range | Interest Rate | Implied Default Rate |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| A (Prime) | 720-850 | 5.5% | 3.0% |
| B (Near Prime) | 680-719 | 7.5% | 6.0% |
| C (Standard) | 640-679 | 9.5% | 6.0% |
| D (Subprime) | 600-639 | 12.5% | 13.0% |
| E (Deep Subprime) | 300-599 | 16.0% | 18.0% |

**Key Insight**: The `implied_default_rate` is what pricing assumes. Compare this against *actual* default rates to find mispricing.

### Industry Classification

Each customer belongs to an **industry** with a historical `default_rate_baseline`. Some industries are inherently riskier (e.g., Hospitality 12.4%) than others (e.g., Technology 4.1%).

### Customer Types

The `is_repeat_customer` flag distinguishes:
- **First-time borrowers**: Higher risk, lower average loan amounts
- **Repeat customers**: Proven track record, significantly lower default rates

## Derived Business Concepts

These metrics don't exist in any single table—they're calculated through JOINs. Use these exact formulas for consistency.

### 1. Actual Default Rate

**Formula:** `COUNT(de.id) / COUNT(l.id) × 100`

```sql
SELECT rg.grade_code,
       ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(de.id) / COUNT(l.id), 2) AS actual_default_rate
FROM loan l
JOIN risk_grade rg ON l.risk_grade_id = rg.id
LEFT JOIN default_event de ON l.id = de.loan_id
GROUP BY rg.grade_code;
```

### 2. Pricing Gap

**Formula:** `implied_default_rate - actual_default_rate`
- Positive = overpriced (may lose customers)
- Negative = underpriced (losing money)
- Grade C has ~-5% gap (significantly underpriced)

```sql
SELECT rg.grade_code,
       rg.implied_default_rate AS pricing_assumption,
       ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(de.id) / COUNT(l.id), 2) AS actual_rate,
       ROUND(rg.implied_default_rate - 100.0 * COUNT(de.id) / COUNT(l.id), 2) AS pricing_gap
FROM risk_grade rg
JOIN loan l ON rg.id = l.risk_grade_id
LEFT JOIN default_event de ON l.id = de.loan_id
GROUP BY rg.id;
```

### 3. Approval Rate

**Formula:** `approved_count / total_applications × 100`

```sql
SELECT ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN ls.status_code = 'APPROVED' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*), 2)
FROM application a
JOIN loan_status ls ON a.status_id = ls.id;
```

### 4. False Rejection (Approval Leakage)

**Criteria:** Rejected customers with credit_score >= (avg successful borrower score - 30)

```sql
WITH successful_profile AS (
    SELECT AVG(c.credit_score) AS avg_score
    FROM loan l
    JOIN customer c ON l.customer_id = c.id
    JOIN loan_status ls ON l.current_status_id = ls.id
    WHERE ls.status_code IN ('CURRENT', 'PAID_OFF')
)
SELECT a.application_number, c.credit_score, a.rejection_reason
FROM application a
JOIN customer c ON a.customer_id = c.id
JOIN loan_status ls ON a.status_id = ls.id
CROSS JOIN successful_profile sp
WHERE ls.status_code = 'REJECTED' AND c.credit_score >= sp.avg_score - 30;
```

### 5. Late Payment Rate

**Formula:** `COUNT(days_late > 0) / COUNT(*) × 100`

```sql
SELECT ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN days_late > 0 THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*), 2) AS late_rate,
       ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN days_late > 0 THEN days_late END), 1) AS avg_days_late
FROM payment;
```

### 6. Partial Payment

**Criteria:** `payment_amount < monthly_payment × 0.95` (5% tolerance)

```sql
SELECT p.loan_id, p.payment_amount, l.monthly_payment,
       ROUND(100.0 * p.payment_amount / l.monthly_payment, 1) AS pct_paid
FROM payment p
JOIN loan l ON p.loan_id = l.id
WHERE p.payment_amount < l.monthly_payment * 0.95;
```

### 7. Recovery Rate & Loss Severity

**Recovery Rate:** `recovery_amount / outstanding_at_default × 100`
**Loss Severity:** `loss_amount / outstanding_at_default × 100` (or `1 - recovery_rate`)

```sql
SELECT rg.grade_code,
       ROUND(100.0 * SUM(de.recovery_amount) / SUM(de.outstanding_at_default), 2) AS recovery_rate,
       ROUND(100.0 * SUM(de.loss_amount) / SUM(de.outstanding_at_default), 2) AS loss_severity
FROM default_event de
JOIN loan l ON de.loan_id = l.id
JOIN risk_grade rg ON l.risk_grade_id = rg.id
GROUP BY rg.grade_code;
```

### 8. Expected Loss

**Formula:** `outstanding_balance × implied_default_rate / 100`

```sql
SELECT l.loan_number, l.outstanding_balance,
       ROUND(l.outstanding_balance * rg.implied_default_rate / 100, 2) AS expected_loss
FROM loan l
JOIN risk_grade rg ON l.risk_grade_id = rg.id
JOIN loan_status ls ON l.current_status_id = ls.id
WHERE ls.status_code = 'CURRENT'
ORDER BY expected_loss DESC;
```

### 9. Portfolio Concentration

**Formula:** `SUM(industry_balance) / SUM(total_balance) × 100`

```sql
SELECT i.industry_name,
       SUM(l.outstanding_balance) AS exposure,
       ROUND(100.0 * SUM(l.outstanding_balance) /
             (SELECT SUM(outstanding_balance) FROM loan), 2) AS pct_of_portfolio
FROM loan l
JOIN customer c ON l.customer_id = c.id
JOIN industry i ON c.industry_id = i.id
GROUP BY i.industry_name
ORDER BY pct_of_portfolio DESC;
```

### 10. Payment Behavior Cohort

**Cohort definitions (first 6 months):**
- Perfect: 0 late, 0 partial
- Mostly On-Time: ≤1 late, 0 partial
- Problematic: 2+ late OR any partial

```sql
WITH early_behavior AS (
    SELECT p.loan_id,
           SUM(CASE WHEN p.days_late > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS late_count,
           SUM(CASE WHEN p.payment_amount < l.monthly_payment * 0.95 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS partial_count
    FROM payment p
    JOIN loan l ON p.loan_id = l.id
    WHERE p.installment_number <= 6
    GROUP BY p.loan_id
)
SELECT CASE
         WHEN late_count = 0 AND partial_count = 0 THEN 'Perfect'
         WHEN late_count <= 1 AND partial_count = 0 THEN 'Mostly On-Time'
         ELSE 'Problematic'
       END AS cohort,
       COUNT(*) AS loans
FROM early_behavior
GROUP BY cohort;
```

### 11. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Compare by customer type:** Repeat customers default ~3.2% vs first-timers ~9.1%

```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN c.is_repeat_customer = 1 THEN 'Repeat' ELSE 'First-Time' END AS type,
       COUNT(DISTINCT c.id) AS customers,
       COUNT(l.id) AS loans,
       ROUND(AVG(l.approved_amount), 0) AS avg_loan,
       ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(de.id) / COUNT(l.id), 2) AS default_rate
FROM customer c
LEFT JOIN loan l ON c.id = l.customer_id
LEFT JOIN default_event de ON l.id = de.loan_id
GROUP BY c.is_repeat_customer;
```

### 12. Vintage Analysis

**Group by origination quarter:**

```sql
SELECT strftime('%Y-Q' || ((CAST(strftime('%m', l.disbursement_date) AS INTEGER) - 1) / 3 + 1),
                l.disbursement_date) AS quarter,
       COUNT(l.id) AS originations,
       ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(de.id) / COUNT(l.id), 2) AS default_rate
FROM loan l
LEFT JOIN default_event de ON l.id = de.loan_id
GROUP BY quarter
ORDER BY quarter;
```

### 13. Early Warning Detection

**Look at payment patterns 60-90 days before default:**

```sql
SELECT de.loan_id,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN p.days_late > 0 THEN 1 END) AS late_payments,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN p.payment_amount < l.monthly_payment * 0.95 THEN 1 END) AS partial_payments
FROM default_event de
JOIN loan l ON de.loan_id = l.id
JOIN payment p ON l.id = p.loan_id
WHERE p.payment_date < de.default_date
  AND p.payment_date >= DATE(de.default_date, '-90 days')
GROUP BY de.loan_id;
```

The `default_event.had_early_warning` and `warning_signals` fields capture pre-computed warnings.

## Table Relationships (How to JOIN)

```
industry.id → customer.industry_id
customer.id → application.customer_id
customer.id → loan.customer_id
application.id → loan.application_id (1:1, only approved applications)
loan_officer.id → application.loan_officer_id
risk_grade.id → loan.risk_grade_id
loan_status.id → application.status_id
loan_status.id → loan.current_status_id
loan.id → repayment_schedule.loan_id
loan.id → payment.loan_id
loan.id → default_event.loan_id (1:1, only defaulted loans)
```

## Key Status Codes

**loan_status.status_code values (8 total):**
- Application stage (`status_category = 'Application'`): `PENDING`, `UNDER_REVIEW`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`
- Active stage (`status_category = 'Active'`): `DISBURSED`, `CURRENT`
- Closed stage (`status_category = 'Closed'`): `DEFAULTED`, `PAID_OFF`

Filter active loans: `status_code IN ('CURRENT', 'DISBURSED')`
Filter completed loans: `status_code IN ('PAID_OFF', 'DEFAULTED')`
Filter rejected applications: `status_code = 'REJECTED'` (note: code is `REJECTED`, not `REJECTED_APPLICATION`)

## SQL Patterns for This Domain

### Calculating Rates (SQLite integer division trap)
```sql
-- WRONG: integer division returns 0
COUNT(defaults) / COUNT(total) * 100

-- CORRECT: force float
COUNT(defaults) * 1.0 / COUNT(total) * 100
```

### Joining Loan to Default Status
```sql
-- To get default info for loans:
FROM loan l
LEFT JOIN default_event de ON l.id = de.loan_id
-- de.id IS NULL means not defaulted
-- COUNT(de.id) counts only defaulted loans
```

### Time-Based Analysis
```sql
-- Payments before a default event:
WHERE p.payment_date < de.default_date
  AND p.payment_date >= DATE(de.default_date, '-90 days')

-- Monthly aggregation:
strftime('%Y-%m', date_column) AS month
```

### Portfolio Percentage
```sql
-- Calculate % of total:
SUM(value) * 1.0 / (SELECT SUM(value) FROM table) * 100
```

## Response Guidelines

- Limit results to 20 rows (`LIMIT 20`)
- Round decimals to 2 places
- Lead with the business insight, then show supporting data
- Highlight anomalies (e.g., "Grade C is underpriced by 5.2 percentage points")

## Safety

- **Read-only**: Only SELECT queries allowed
- Never attempt UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, or DROP
- If asked to modify data, explain this is an analytics-only system

## Debug Report

After answering, call `write_debug_report` with:
- User question
- Tables used and why
- SQL query executed
- Result interpretation
- Final answer summary
